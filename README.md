# HVAC Predictive Maintenance System

A machine learning system that predicts HVAC equipment failures using sensor data.

##  Project Overview
- Predicts HVAC system failures 30-50 cycles in advance
- Achieves **96.3% accuracy** with Random Forest
- Identifies most important sensors for maintenance focus
- Prepares data for Power BI dashboard integration

##  Results
- **Accuracy**: 96.3%
- **Precision**: 93% 
- **Recall**: 84%
- **F1-Score**: 88%

##  Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `Predictive_Maintenance_HVAC.ipynb`

##  Key Features
- Feature engineering with rolling averages
- Handling imbalanced data with class weights
- Business impact analysis with cost savings
- Model comparison (Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting vs SVM)

##  Business Impact
- Early failure detection reduces maintenance costs
- Identifies critical sensors for proactive maintenance
- Dashboard-ready outputs for operations teams
